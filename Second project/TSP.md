# Team Software Process

### Origins
The Team Software Process, which we'll refer to as TSP from now on, was designed by Watts Humphrey in the late 1900s. Its technical report was published in November 2000.  
In 1996, Humphrey attempted TSP0, a simple process for teams whose members who had received no previous guidance other than PSP. It was solely attempted on two teams and over the course of two years it evolved to its current state.

### Design
According to the creator, the TCP was designed for use with teams of 2 to 20 members. It aims to help build and provide guidance to teams of skilled and effectively trained members. The teams are led by a certified or provisional coach, who has been specially trained.
It is required that engineers have already learnt about the Personal Software Process (PSP), intended to improve estimating and planning skills as well as project improvement.

### Conditions for teamwork
Humphrey describes that each team member must have roles, given that they provide a sense of ownership and belonging. Roles prevent conflicts, duplicate work and wasted effort.  
Interdependancy is also crucial as each team member depends to some degree on the performance of others. It **improves** individual performance as members will generally make a special effort to meet their obligations to the rest of the team.  
For a team to be effective, some common characteristics are required such as disciplined and motivated members as well as its goal being defined, visible and realistic. They must strive to meet demanding schedules whilst adjusting to change.

### The principles
These are the major values of the TSP method:
* Commitment
* Aggressive plans
* Quality ownership
* Project goals
* Plan ownership
* Plan detail
* Team roles
* Team resources

### The process
The TSP development cycle starts with a four-day planning process called the **team launch** to develop the project's strategy, process and plan with a three to four month expectancy.  
The team launch lasts about 9 meetings over the course of 4 days and do follow scripts.  
* On day 1, team members are assigned team roles and backup roles and the project's strategy and products to use is set.
* On day 2, size estimates and allocation of work to team members is processed.
* On day 3, project's risks are evaluated and risk assessment checkpoints are defined.
* On the final day, the project's plans are discussed and reviewed by the management.

After 9 meetings, the development cycle ends with a **final postmortem step** aimed to review the launch process and submit process improvement proposals (PIPs).   
Following its iterative design, TSP teams are relaunched periodically to assess on the knowledge gained on the previous cycle and to update the engineers' detailed plans.  

### Key pros and cons
According to a study by Capers Jones published on May 2013, TSP ranks 3rd from the list of most efficient software development strategies, only surpassed by Scrum and XP. On average, its use results on a development schedule of just over a year for applications of 1000 function points.  
The study also lists TSP as first on its ability to detect and correct software defects and also first on the matter of Total Cost of Ownership and Cost of Quality. These refer to the costs of maintenance which end up being very low as a result of TSP's quality-related methods instead of speed-related methods.  
On average, TSP can provide you the fewest defects at the cost of an extra development month period. Strategies like Agile and Scrum do tend to be faster but result on more software flaws and, therefore, higher maintenance costs.

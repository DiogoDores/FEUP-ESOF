# Team Software Process

### Origins
The team software process, which we'll refer as TSP from now on, was designed by Watts Humphrey in the late 1900s. Its technical report was published in November 2000.  
* In 1996, Humphrey attempted TSP0, a simple process for teams whose members who had received no previous guidance other than PSP. It was attempted on two teams.

### Design
According to the creator, the TCP was designed for use with teams of 2 to 20 members. It aims to help build and provide guidance to teams of skilled and effectively trained members.

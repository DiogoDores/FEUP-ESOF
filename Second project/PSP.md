# The Personal Software Process

The Personal Software Process (PSP) provides engineers with a disciplined personal framework for doing software work. The PSP process consists of a set of methods, forms, and scripts that show software engineers how to plan, measure, and manage their work. This assists in the further improvement of their performance by tracking their predicted and actual development of code. 

### Origin

Since the times of the Industrial Revolution the quality strategy in most industries was based almost entirely on testing. Typically, established special quality departments were created to find and fix problems after their products had already been produced. This method kept being used until, in the late 70s, W. Edwards Deming and J.M. Juran convinced U.S. industry to focus on improving the way people did their jobs. This change was responsible, in the succeeding years, for an improvement in the quality of almost any kind of product. This step consequently led to the progress of this method throughout the years, expanding it to every kind of industry or company.

One of these steps was taken in software engineering with the Personal Software Process (PSP) created by **Watts Humphrey** in 1995. The PSP extends the improvement process to the people who actually do the work â€” the practicing engineers. The PSP concentrates on the work practices of the individual engineers. The principle behind it is that to produce quality software systems, every engineer who works on the system must do quality work.

### Principles

The PSP design is based on the following planning and quality principles:
* Planning
* Well-defined and measured processes
* Quality work
* Low cost development
* Efficient development
* Simplicity

All these principles need to be tailored to each specific individual. Every engineer is different and have different needs.


### Process Structure

The first step in the PSP process is planning. There is a planning script that guides this work and a plan summary for recording the planning data. While the engineers are following the script to do the work, they record their time and defect data on the time and defect logs. At the end of the job, during the postmortem phase (PM), they summarize the time and defect data from the logs, measure the program size, and enter these data in the plan summary form. When done, they deliver the finished product along with the completed plan summary form.

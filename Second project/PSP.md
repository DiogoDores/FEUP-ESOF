# The Personal Software Process

The Personal Software Process (PSP) provides engineers with a disciplined personal framework for doing software work. The PSP process consists of a set of methods, forms, and scripts that show software engineers how to plan, measure, and manage their work. This assists in the further improvement of their performance by tracking their predicted and actual development of code. 

### Origin

Since the times of the Industrial Revolution the quality strategy in most industries was based almost entirely on testing. Typically, established special quality departments were created to find and fix problems after their products had already been produced. This method kept being used until, in the late 70s, **W. Edwards Deming** and **J.M. Juran** convinced U.S. industry to focus on improving the way people did their jobs. This change was responsible, in the succeeding years, for an improvement in the quality of almost any kind of product. This step consequently led to the progress of this method throughout the years, expanding it to every kind of industry or company.

One of these steps was taken in software engineering with the Personal Software Process (PSP) created by Watts Humphrey in 1995. The PSP extends the improvement process to the people who actually do the work â€” the practicing engineers. The PSP concentrates on the work practicesof the individual engineers. The principle behind it is that to produce quality software systems, every engineer who works on the system must do quality work.

# The Personal Software Process

The Personal Software Process (PSP) provides engineers with a disciplined personal framework for doing software work. The PSP process consists of a set of methods, forms, and scripts that show software engineers how to plan, measure, and manage their work. This assists in the further improvement of their performance by tracking their predicted and actual development of code. 

### Origin

Since the times of the Industrial Revolution the quality strategy in most industrial organizations had been based almost entirely on testing. Industries typically established special quality departments to find and fix problems after their products had already been produced. This method kept being used until, in the late 70s, W. Edwards Deming and J.M. Juran convinced U.S. industry to focus on improving the way people did their jobs. This change was responsible, in the succeeding years, for a spike of improvements in the quality of almost any kind of product.

### Abstract

  Extreme programmimg(XP) is a software development methodology, first starting in March 6th, 1996 with the purpose of improving software quality and responsiveness. It was a type of Agile software development and has proven to be very successful at many companies worldwide. This is mostly due to Extreme Programming being extremely reliant on customer satisfaction.

### How it Started

  In the 1990's Kent Beck was researching on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project. During his work he became the project leader and ended up creating the Extreme Programming methodology. However, this wasn't the first case of Extreme Programming known, many practices had already been used for some, including on Nasa's "Project Mercury". 

### What it's for
  Extreme Programming delivers the software to the customers whenever they need it. The developers can always respond to ever-changing customer requirements. This is achieved my having multiple short development cycles, rather than a long one.
  XP emphasizes teamwork allowing managers, customers and developers to be apart of the same team. This allows the team solve a problem as efficiently as possible. EP can be divided into two concepts: **Values** and **Activities**.
  
### Activities
  Activities can be divided into 4 main software development processes: coding, testing, listening and designing. 
  
  **Coding** is believed the only true important product of the system development process. XP programmers believe they can better communicate with one another through code. Thus, they start to generate codes at the very begnning so that they always have one program.
  
  **Testing** is always necessary. What better way to see if a piece of code is working than by testing it? To do this, XP often uses Unit Tests (automated tests) and programmers will write tests to try and break the code they just wrote. The fewer the tests that crash the program, the better the code.
  
  For XP developers their capabilieties and expertise in techincal abilities should always be accompanied by the ability to be good **listeners**. This will make them be able to better design what the customers require and desire.
  
  Even though XP is known for it's simplicity it doesn't mean that designing a proper structure should be completely off the table. In fact, it is very important for preventing long run systems from becoming too complex. Developers should be very careful in early stages so as to prevent projects from coming to a halt.

### Values
  XP has 5 cornerstone values (the 5th was added in the second edition of *Extreme Programming Explained*).
  
   **Comumnication** is encouraged between programmers. Since XP is very focused on teamwork by communicating with one another the goal is to give all developers a shared view of what they are supposed to do. Of course, it is also beneficial to have a healthy communication with the customers, since they are the ones who dictate what the team should do.

### Abstract

  Extreme programmimg is a software development methodology, first starting in March 6th, 1996 with the purpose of improving software quality and responsiveness. It was a type of Agile software development and has proven to be very successful at many companies worldwide. This is mostly due to Extreme Programming being extremely reliant on customer satisfaction.

### How it Started

  In the 1990's Kent Beck was researching on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project. During his work he became the project leader and ended up creating the Extreme Programming methodology. However, this wasn't the first case of Extreme Programming known, many practices had already been used for some, including on Nasa's "Project Mercury". 

### What it's for
  Extreme Programming delivers the software to the customers whenever they need it. The developers can always respond to ever-changing customer requirements. This is achieved my having multiple short development cycles, rather than a long one.
  EP emphasizes teamwork allowing managers, customers and developers to be apart of the same team. This allows the team solve a problem as efficiently as possible. EP can be divided into two concepts: **Values** and **Activities**.

# Extreme Programming

 Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology, first starting in March 6th, 1996 with the purpose of improving software quality and responsiveness. It was a type of Agile software development and has proven to be very successful at many companies worldwide. This is mostly due to Extreme Programming being extremely reliant on customer satisfaction.

### How it Started

  In the 1990's Kent Beck was researching on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project. During his work he became the project leader and ended up creating the Extreme Programming methodology. However, this wasn't the first case of Extreme Programming known, as many practices had already been used for some time, including on Nasa's "Project Mercury". 

### What's it for
  Extreme Programming delivers the software to the customers whenever they need it. The developers can always respond to ever-changing customer requirements. This is achieved by having multiple short development cycles, rather than a long one.
  XP emphasizes teamwork, allowing managers, customers and developers to be a part of the same team. This allows the team to solve a problem as efficiently as possible. XP can be divided into two concepts: **Values** and **Activities**.
  
  ### Values
  XP has 5 cornerstone values (the 5th was added in the second edition of *Extreme Programming Explained*). Communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect.
  
   **Comumnication** is encouraged between programmers. Since XP is very focused on teamwork by communicating with one another the goal is to give all developers a shared view of what they are supposed to do. Of course, it is also beneficial to have a healthy communication with the customers, since they are the ones who dictate what the team should do.
   
   In XP it is recommended to always start with the **simplest** solution. The YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it) approach is often used. Programmers don't focus much on future investments because they are very uncertain about them and doing so may be a waste of valuable time and resources. Instead, they focus on taking one problem at a time, giving more effort for things they need for today, instead of next week or next month.
   
   **Feedback** is closely related to communication and simplicity. The main feedback givers are the system, the customer and the team. Programmers have direct feedback from the system on the current state of their program through unit tests and compilation runs. The customers periodically evaluate the work of the developer team and state their opinion on whether the program is currently to their liking or not. The team can give feedback to one another stating if they are working correctly and give feedback to the customer by giving an estimate of time of how long a project will take and how much it will cost.
   
   **Courage** is needed for certain tasks. As stated before, it takes courage to code for today instead of tomorrow. It also enables developers to refactor their code whenever they find it appropriate (and sometimes refactoring can be extremely complicated). Courage is also important when it comes to throw code away (code that is now obsolete or that no longer makes sense when refactoring). It makes the developers more persistent when struggling and able to take their problems head on. They don't give up because they know that the next day they might be able to find a solution.
   
   **Respect** is a very important value. Programmers should not ignore the problems of other members of their team. They  musn't commit code that may break the code of others and always need to discuss what their next step should be, instead of acting as a lone wolf and facing the project without consulting others.
  
### Activities
  Activities can be divided into 4 main software development processes: coding, testing, listening and designing. 
  
  **Coding** is believed to be the only true important product of the system development process. XP programmers believe they can better communicate with one another through code. Thus, they start to generate codes at the very begnning so that they always have one program.
  
  **Testing** is always necessary. What better way to see if a piece of code is working than by testing it? To do this, XP often uses Unit Tests (automated tests) and programmers will write tests to try and break the code they just wrote. The fewer the tests that crash the program, the better the code.
  
  For XP developers their capabilities and expertise in techincal abilities should always be accompanied by the ability to be good **listeners**. This will make them be able to better design what the customers require and desire.
  
  Even though XP is known for it's simplicity it doesn't mean that designing a proper structure should be completely off the table. In fact, it is of utmost importance for preventing long run systems from becoming too complex. Developers should be very careful in early stages so as to prevent projects from coming to a halt.

  ### Pros and Cons
  XP is very cost efficient, sparing the developers from a lot of paperwork and meetings and focusing more on the code itself. The cost of making changes increases the more the software advances in its life cycle, so it's better to change your code in the development stage, which is what XP does, whether than after delivery, which is what most other development techniques do.
  Another major pro is that since the work is equally divided amongst team members, there is no huge dependency on one member providing a crucial part of the program. This reduces risk of breakdown of the project. Teams are usually more satisfied with this kind of approach.
  The biggest disadvantage in XP is that it assumes the constant involvment of the customer. It relies heavily on this and the truth is  the customer might not be available or may even dislike this kind of involvment. This could be a problem in the development stage.

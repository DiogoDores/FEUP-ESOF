Ashley Madison is a website where useres can register and seek relationships with otheres, whether they're already in a relationship themselves or not. It was one of the first websites to offer the oportunity of having extramarital affairs discretely.

In July of 2015, Avid Life Media (Ashley Madison's parent firm) employees recieved a threatening message from a team named "The Impact Team" that said they would post all website registered users' information unless they terminated Ashley Madison together with Established Men (a similar website). The Impact Team gave AVL a deadline of 30 days to fulfill their requests. Four days after the threat, the team posted information of two men to show that they truly had the information that they said they did.

In August of the same year, they posted a message on pastebin with the title "TIME'S UP" containing a torrent file with about 10 gigabytes in size with emails of many users. Many emails belonged to government, army or corporate members. Some new websites with the purpose of searching whether or not a certain email had been posted started to pop up. There were a few doubts about the truthfullness of the data that had been posted but many users admitted publically and confirmed that their information had been leaked.

Two days after the initial post comes another with about 20 gigabytes in size. This time it was different as the data leaked was not about the users, but about AVL's employees, including its CEO Noel Biderman and source code from the website.

Until the end of August a few more posts were made with user emails belonging to Canada and numerous states from the USA. Two law firm companies from Canada sued Ashley Madison on behalf of the citizens of their country for a total of $578 million.

This information leak had a huge social impact. Many users separated from their spouses and others, because of their high management jobs were targets of great controversy. The police from Toronto reported two suicides as a consequence due to the incident. The company lost a huge amount of users and had a great monetary loss. They had to pay $11.2 million to the state and Noel Biderman resigned on the 28th of August of 2015.

The security of the company was highly criticized. The team that attacked the servers claimed that they practically had no resistence and that the users had very weak passwords due to a lack of parameters established by the website and due to the weak password encription made. The team posted a list with the most common passwords and at the top was "123456" used by about 120.000 users.
